# School_age_Calculator
I Developed a Simple Age Calculator Which will Take the name and age of a Student from User as Input and will give Compare the given age with predifined age and tell the user that Student is eligable for going to school or not.
First We Define a Function with the name of School_Calculator()
then we take the Name and Age as input from User
after getting name and age from user
Calculator will Comapre the given age if the age is greater then or equal to 5 Calcultor will print that the (Name , can join the School)
if the age is greater the 12 the Calcultor will print that the (Name , Should go to higher School)
other wise if the given age is less then 5 the Calcultor will print that the (Name ,is Still a Baby)
